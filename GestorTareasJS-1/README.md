# Task Manager

This project is a simple task manager application built with JavaScript. It allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The application uses local storage to persist tasks across sessions, ensuring that your tasks remain available even after refreshing the page.

## Files

- `src/tareas.js`: Contains the JavaScript code for managing tasks, including functions for adding, deleting, and updating task statuses.
- `index.html`: The main HTML document that provides the structure for the task manager interface.

## Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/cristinabarandiaran/GestorTareasJS.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd GestorTareasJS
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view and interact with the task manager.

## Usage

1. Enter a task in the input field and click the "Agregar" button or press Enter to add the task to the list.
2. Click the checkbox next to a task to mark it as completed. The task will be displayed with a strikethrough.
3. Click the trash can icon to delete a task from the list.

Enjoy managing your tasks!
